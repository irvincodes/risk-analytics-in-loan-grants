### Problem Statement

In the financial industry, it is crucial for lenders to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers before granting loans or credit. Identifying potential defaulters, who are at higher risk of failing to repay their debts, can help mitigate financial losses and maintain a healthy lending portfolio.

When the financial institution reviews a loan application, it must make a decision regarding approval, taking into account the applicant's profile. This decision involves two types of risks:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, rejecting their application results in a missed opportunity of business revenue for the company.

Conversely, if the applicant is highly unlikely to repay the loan, approving their application may expose the company to a potential financial loss in the event of default.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify borrowers as defaulters or non-defaulters based on various financial and demographic factors.

The data set is well represented by both sets of gender and not biased towards any.

Subsequently, I do further EDA analysis on the dataset before utilising Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to train and evaluate the models.

*Further details can be seen in my Jupyter Notebook Repo file where the most important features used to predict defaulters vs non-defaulters are identified.*

To conclude, I come up with key insights and a set of business recommendations for the business.
